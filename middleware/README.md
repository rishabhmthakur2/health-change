# Health'Change Middleware

Built using Node.js and uses `web3.js` and `js-ipfs`.
This layer functions as the <i>brain of Health'Change</i> as it handles all the API calls, routing, executions and transaction queuing. 

## How to run

Make sure you are within the `middleware` folder and that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system. Then run the following commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can now test all the API routes using tools like [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/)
